## Background

This repository contains the 4 R scripts submitted in fulfillment of Assignment 1 of the COURSERA Exploratory Data Analysis Course.

The assignment uses data from the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. The data set used for the assignment concerns the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which is available on the course web site in zip format:

* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

## The R scripts
 
There are 4 scripts:

*  plot1.R

This script produces an histogram of the Global Active Power comsumption in kilowatts. 
The script outputs the plot to a PNG file in the sub-directory 'figure' in the current-working directory as: plot1.png

*  plot2.R

This script plots a line graph of the Global Active Power comsumption in kilowatts over the two-day period of 1 Feb 2007 and 2 Feb 2007. 

The script outputs the plot to a PNG file in the sub-directory 'figure' in the current-working directory as: plot2.png


*  plot3.R

This script plots the 3 types of Energy Sub-metering for the  two-day period of 1 Feb 2007 and 2 Feb 2007. 

The script outputs the plot to a PNG file in the sub-directory 'figure' in the current-working directory as: plot3.png

*  plot4.R

This script produces 4 plots over the two-day period of 1 Feb 2007 and 2 Feb 2007: 
           -  plot of Global Active Power comsumption
           -  plot of Voltage 
           -  plot of Energy Sub-metering
           -  plot of Global Re-active Power comsumption
           
The script outputs the plot to a PNG file in the sub-directory 'figure' in the current-working directory as: plot4.png

## Running the scripts

## Making Plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)

For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.


The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.
